-algorithm:
    Search nprobe=32 nearest clusters for each query embedding. 
    Compute the distances of vectors in the clusters. Use the distance to compute partial matrix.
    Use the partial matrix for ranking, get top-n_stage1=5000 candidates.
    Use rabitq estimated distance to do final (full matrix) reranking.

-algorithm:
    Search nprobe=32 nearest clusters for each query embedding. 
    Compute the distances of vectors in the clusters. Impute the missing distance with centroid score of farthest cluster.
    Directly use the imputed matrix for ranking.

Thoughts:
1. Can optimize efficiency of reranking using rabitq estimated distances?
2. Can imputed distance be better estimated?
